# Code base for the manuscript "Multi-modal characterization and simulation of human epileptic circuitry"

![](/images/figure_TLE_summary.png)

This repository contains the code that is necessary to reproduce the work of Buchin et al. 2020 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.060178v1). The repository contains the code for Python, Matlab and R used in this study. To make is easier to comprehend, the code is organized into subdirectories that correspond to figures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Anaconda Python 4.3.13 (Python 2.7)

Brain Modeling Toolkit (https://alleninstitute.github.io/bmtk/)

Allen SDK (https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/)

Neuron 7.4 (https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/)

Rstudio (https://rstudio.com/)

Matlab R2018a (https://www.mathworks.com/)


### Requirements

Enviroment requirements could be found in requirements folder: requirements.txt and epilepsy_human_dg_network.yml file

To install the enviroment run:
conda env create -f epilepsy_human_dg.yml

or

conda env create -f environment.yml -p /home/user/anaconda3/envs/env_name



Data analysis code is organized using the corresponding folders. All necessary functions and vizualisations are included into the notebooks. The original data files including nwb, swc and RData files are available upon request.


### Installing

The models will run automatickally once you have the required libraries installed on your machine, such as:

Python Anaconda 2.7 including R
